          &mdash;
          <p class="introduction">
            “I need to prepare for <em>GATE</em>”—Dr. Deep asked his professor. “You should take <em>HM8085</em> and have a visit to <em>computerland</em>—you will definitely find yourself in good position after visit.”—Professor X said to Dr. Deep.
            <br/><br/>
            Dr. Deep contacted <em>HM8085</em>—ship captained by Capt. Jack Sparrow—known for his witty nature and intelligent mind. “Have you got map of <em>computerland</em>?”—Captain asked Dr. Deep. Paul has just arranged, Dr. Deep replied. 
            <br/><br/>
            “I am going to take you to <em>mathcity</em> from there you need to travel on your own!”—Sparrow forwarded. 
          </p>
          &mdash;

          <blockquote>
            <h3>Captain Jack Sparrow &amp; this famous HM8085</h3>
            He is well known in Computerland&trade; &mdash; for his mathematical skills. He is very good in mathematics and he usually loves puzzles, Paul and Dr. Deep will be learning about basic set theory, functions, relations from Captain through–out their sailing. 
          </blockquote>

          &mdash;

            Paul is very curious—he wanted to know how Captain Sparrow keeps track of this people, ship amenities, coals. Captain Sparrow told Paul about <em>‘set theory’</em>—as he was speaking to Paul, I started taking notes and here is what I noted—

              'Set Theory'
            </h2>
            <p>
              “Concept of set appears in all mathematics, we need to know about its terminology and notation.”, he started.
              <br><br>
              Set can be viewed as any well–defined collection of objects called ‘elements’ or ‘members’ of set. Synonyms for ‘set’ are ‘classes, ‘collection’ and ‘family.’ 
              <br><br>
              There essentially two ways of specifying a particular set—one way if possible is to list its members separated by commas and contained in braces {} where–as second way is to state those properties which categorized the elements in set.
              <br><br>
              He illustrated example for first way as— <br>
              A = {‘Bruce’, ‘Will’, ‘Sam’} and another way as <br>
              B = {x | x is an integer and x > 0}
            </p>

            <h2>
              <small>Day 1</small><br>
              'Set Theory'
            </h2>
            <p>
              Subsets—suppose every element in set A is also an element of set B then A is called as subset of B. We also say that A is contained in B or B contains A. 
              <br><br>
              All sets under investigation in any application of set theory are assumed to belong to some fixed large set called as ‘universal set’ which is denoted by U.
              <br>
              When set has no elements—it is called the empty set or null set.
              <br><br>
              Set operations— <br/>
              Union—it is set of all elements which belong to A or to B.<br>
              Intersection—it is set of all elements which belong to both A and B.<br><br>
              If two sets have no common elements—they referred to disjoint or non–intersecting. If S is union of two set A &amp; B and there are no common elements in A &amp; B—in such cases S is called as ‘disjoint union’ of A and B.
