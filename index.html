His professor gave him a map—Map to learn basic of Computer Science. He took his mojo—Paul, the genius monkeyoid; and from St. Dell harbor and he took HM 8085 captained by Captain Jack Sparrow—read out here what they planned for their journey.</em>

They both are now in famous city of Automata—city owned and operated by machines; Dr. Deep needs to create a machine which can decode alien language before it’s too late; They both met Jedi Turing—who promised them that he is going to help them.
